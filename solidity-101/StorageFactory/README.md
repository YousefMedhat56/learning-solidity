# StorageFactory Project
The StorageFactory project demonstrates how to deploy and manage multiple instances of a smart contract programmatically. It consists of two smart contracts:
### 1. SimpleStorage Contract:

A basic contract that allows users to store, retrieve, and map their favorite numbers by name. It includes functionality for adding people and storing associated favorite numbers in a list and mapping.

### 2. StorageFactory Contract:

A factory contract that creates new instances of the SimpleStorage contract. It also facilitates interaction with these deployed instances, such as storing and retrieving favorite numbers for a specific SimpleStorage instance.

## Learning outcomes
The project covers the basics of Solidity and smart contract development through these following key concepts:
### 1. Smart Contract Composition 
Learn how to write and structure smart contracts with variables, functions, mappings, and arrays.
### 2. Inheritance 
Learn how to use inheritance in smart contracts and override methods of the parent contract.
### 3. Inter-Contract Communication
Learn how to import and deploy a contract from another contract.
